\chapter{Introduction}
Unit testing is a fundamental software testing technique that involves verifying individual components or functions of a program to ensure they operate as intended. By focusing on the smallest testable parts of an application, such as functions or methods, unit testing helps developers identify and fix bugs at an early stage of development.

The importance of unit testing cannot be overstated. It provides several key benefits:

\textbf{1. Early Bug Detection:} \\
 By testing components in isolation, developers can catch defects before they propagate to other parts of the application, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later in the development process.


\textbf{2. Improved Code Quality:} \\
Writing unit tests encourages developers to create modular and maintainable code. When code is designed to be testable, it often leads to better organization and separation of concerns.

\textbf{3. Facilitates Changes:}\\
 Unit tests serve as a safety net, allowing developers to make changes or refactor code with confidence. If a change breaks existing functionality, the unit tests will fail, signaling that further investigation is needed.

\textbf{4. Documentation of Intent:} \\
Unit tests can act as a form of documentation, clarifying how a particular piece of code is intended to behave. This is especially helpful for new team members who need to understand the codebase.

\textbf{5. Supports Continuous Integration:} \\
Automated unit tests can be integrated into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline, ensuring that code changes are tested frequently and consistently.
\\

This document outlines the key principles of unit testing, providing practical examples in Java to illustrate how these principles can be applied effectively. By understanding and implementing these principles, developers can enhance the reliability and maintainability of their software projects.



\chapter{Types of Tests}
\section{Unit Test}
\textbf{Definition:} Unit testing is used to verify the functionality of a specific section or function of code. \\
\textbf{Usage:} It is used by developers during the early stages of development, focusing on small units, such as individual functions or methods. \\
\textbf{Benefits:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Catches errors early in the development cycle.
    \item Ensures code quality by validating the smallest parts of the application.
\end{itemize}

\section{Integration Test}
\textbf{Definition:} Integration testing checks the interaction between different modules or services within an application. \\
\textbf{Usage:} It is used when multiple components need to interact, ensuring they work together as expected. \\
\textbf{Benefits:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Helps catch interface issues between modules.
    \item Ensures modules behave correctly in combination.
\end{itemize}

\section{End-to-End (E2E) Test}
\textbf{Definition:} E2E testing simulates real user scenarios, testing the application from start to finish. \\
\textbf{Usage:} It is used in later stages of development to ensure that the entire system functions as expected in a real-world context. \\
\textbf{Benefits:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides confidence that user workflows are intact.
    \item Tests the system as a whole, catching issues that unit or integration tests may miss.
\end{itemize}

\section{Regression Test}
\textbf{Definition:} Regression testing verifies that recent code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality. \\
\textbf{Usage:} It is used after updates, bug fixes, or new feature implementations to ensure that other parts of the application remain stable. \\
\textbf{Benefits:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Detects issues introduced by new code.
    \item Maintains software stability over time.
\end{itemize}

\section{Load Test}
\textbf{Definition:} Load testing measures system performance under a heavy load, such as a high volume of users or requests. \\
\textbf{Usage:} It is used to verify that the application can handle expected or above-average levels of traffic. \\
\textbf{Benefits:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identifies potential bottlenecks.
    \item Ensures application reliability and performance under load.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{FIRST Principles}

\section{Fast}
\textbf{Explanation:} Unit tests should execute quickly to encourage frequent testing during development.\\
\textbf{Why:} Fast tests help developers receive immediate feedback on their changes, allowing them to identify and fix issues without significant delays. When tests take too long, developers may skip them, leading to potential undetected errors.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In a team developing a web application, lengthy tests can deter developers from running them regularly. Fast tests ensure that errors are caught early, maintaining overall code quality.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

public class MathUtilsTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testAdd() {
        assert MathUtils.add(2, 3) == 5;  // This test is fast!
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Independent}
\textbf{Explanation:} Tests should not rely on the results of other tests. Each test should be able to run in isolation.\\
\textbf{Why:} Independent tests simplify debugging. If a test fails, developers can focus on that specific test without worrying about other tests influencing the outcome.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In a banking application, if a user creation test relies on a login test, a failure in the login test could incorrectly indicate an issue with user creation, complicating debugging.
\\ \\ \\ \\  \\ \\ \\ \\

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class UserService {
    public String createUser(String username) {
        return "User created";
    }

    public String login(String username, String password) {
        return "Login successful";
    }
}

public class UserServiceTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testCreateUser() {
        UserService userService = new UserService();
        assert userService.createUser("username").equals("User created");
    }

    @org.junit.Test
    public void testLoginUser() {
        UserService userService = new UserService();
        assert userService.login("username", "password").equals("Login successful");
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Repeatable}
\textbf{Explanation:} Tests should produce the same results every time they are executed, regardless of when or where they run.\\
\textbf{Why:} Repeatable tests build trust in the testing process. If tests yield inconsistent results, developers may lose confidence in their ability to identify and fix bugs.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In a data processing application, if a test that generates reports produces varying results, it becomes challenging to determine whether the code or the test itself is faulty.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class RandomFunction {
    public static int randomFunction(int seed) {
        return 42; // Fixed return for simplicity
    }
}

public class RandomFunctionTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testFixedRandom() {
        assert RandomFunction.randomFunction(1) == 42;  // Same seed yields the same result
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Self-Validating}
\textbf{Explanation:} Tests should clearly indicate whether they pass or fail without manual intervention.\\
\textbf{Why:} Self-validating tests allow developers to quickly assess the health of their code. If tests require manual checking, it introduces human error and slows down the development process.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In a mobile app handling payments, having self-validating tests ensures that any failures are immediately apparent, allowing the team to act quickly to resolve issues.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtils {
    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}

public class MathUtilsTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testMultiply() {
        assert MathUtils.multiply(3, 4) == 12;  // This is self-validating
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Timely}
\textbf{Explanation:} Tests should be written close to the time of the code they are meant to verify.\\
\textbf{Why:} Writing tests immediately after coding ensures that they accurately reflect the intended functionality. Delaying tests can lead to forgetting important details about the code.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} If a developer adds a feature to a web application and waits weeks to write tests, they might forget specific behaviors, increasing the risk of bugs slipping into production.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class Feature {
    public static String newFeature() {
        return "New feature implemented!";
    }
}

public class FeatureTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testNewFeature() {
        assert Feature.newFeature().equals("New feature implemented!");  // Written immediately after the feature
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{SAND Principles}

\section{Simple}
\textbf{Explanation:} Keep tests straightforward and easy to understand.\\
\textbf{Why:} Simple tests are easier to maintain and reduce the cognitive load on developers. When tests are clear, it’s easier for team members to understand the intended functionality.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In a complex system, simple tests can act as documentation, helping new developers quickly grasp the codebase and its expected behavior.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtilsTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testAddPositiveNumbers() {
        assert MathUtils.add(1, 2) == 3;  // Simple and clear
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Automated}
\textbf{Explanation:} Tests should be automated to run without manual input.\\
\textbf{Why:} Automated tests can be run continuously throughout the development process, providing constant feedback and helping catch regressions early.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In large software projects, automating tests ensures that every code submission is evaluated against existing functionality, reducing the likelihood of introducing new bugs.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=sh]
# Command to run all tests in a test suite
mvn test
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Necessary}
\textbf{Explanation:} Only write tests that provide value to avoid unnecessary complexity.\\
\textbf{Why:} Writing unnecessary tests can waste time and complicate the test suite without improving overall code quality. It’s essential to focus on critical functionalities.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In an application managing user accounts, spending time testing trivial methods (like simple getters) may not be worthwhile compared to testing more complex business logic.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class TestService {
    public String getName() {
        return "Test";
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Deterministic}
\textbf{Explanation:} Tests should consistently return the same result.\\
\textbf{Why:} Deterministic tests are crucial for maintaining reliability in the testing process. If tests yield different results under the same conditions, it leads to confusion and mistrust.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In a healthcare application, a test for calculating medication dosages must yield the same result every time it runs to ensure patient safety and reliability.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class FixedValue {
    public static int getFixedValue() {
        return 10;  // Should always return 10
    }
}

public class FixedValueTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testFixedValue() {
        assert FixedValue.getFixedValue() == 10;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{RED-GREEN-REFACTOR}

\section{Red}
\textbf{Explanation:} Write a test for functionality that doesn’t exist yet. The test should fail.\\
\textbf{Why:} This phase clarifies the requirements and expected behavior before writing the actual code, ensuring a clear understanding of what needs to be implemented.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} When developing a new payment feature, writing a failing test first helps the team define how the feature should behave, preventing misunderstandings later on.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtilsTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testSubtract() {
        assert MathUtils.subtract(5, 3) == 2;  // Fails because subtract is not implemented
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Green}
\textbf{Explanation:} Write just enough code to make the test pass.\\
\textbf{Why:} This phase focuses on implementing the minimum required functionality to satisfy the test, preventing over-engineering and ensuring rapid progress.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} For the payment feature, the team implements only the necessary code to pass the test, allowing them to validate their approach quickly before refining it.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtils {
    public static int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;  
        // Now the test passes
    }
}

\end{lstlisting}

\section{Refactor}
\textbf{Explanation:} Clean up your code while ensuring tests still pass.\\
\textbf{Why:} Refactoring improves code quality and maintainability without altering functionality, making it easier to extend and understand in the future.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} After implementing the payment feature, the team reviews the code for clarity and performance, ensuring that it remains easy to work with as new features are added.

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtils {
    public static int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;  // Refactored for clarity, tests still pass
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\chapter{Test-Driven Development (TDD)}

\textbf{Explanation:} Write tests before the actual code. This drives the design of your code.\\
\textbf{Why:} TDD encourages developers to think critically about the requirements and design of their code, leading to better structured and more reliable software.

\textbf{Real-World Example:} In an agile development environment, using TDD helps teams maintain a focus on requirements and encourages collaboration between developers and stakeholders.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write a test for a new feature.
    \item Implement just enough code to pass the test.
    \item Refactor as needed, ensuring all tests still pass.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
public class MathUtilsTest {
    @org.junit.Test
    public void testDivide() {
        assert MathUtils.divide(10, 2) == 5;  // Fails initially
    }
}

public class MathUtils {
    public static int divide(int a, int b) {
        return a / b;  // Now the test passes
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
